              <h1>My favourite sport: American football</h1> 
              <p>American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron,
                 is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. 
                 The offense, which is the team with possession of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the 
                 field by running with or passing the ball, while the defense, which is the team without possession of the ball,
                  aims to stop the offense's advance and to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance
                   at least ten yards in four downs, or plays; if they fail, they turn over the football to the defense, but 
                   if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs to continue the drive. Points are primarily scored 
                   by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the 
                   opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.
              </p>
              <h2>How I met with American football</h2>
                <p>My first experience with American football was a TV show at SPORT1 channel. It was a SuperBowl - USA most famous sport final.
                  It was very intersting to see 22 player in a field with full procetive equipment. Honestly, I didn't know what I was, 
                  but it looked awesome. A lot of runs, passes and collisions. Everything happened so fast, a quick huddle and then action. <br />
                  After this, I didn't heard about American football for a while. I also played american football during my University studies.<br /> 
                  But how I met with the team and how I joined to the team? 
              </p>
              <p>
                  When I went to college I noticed that my friend (a guy!) attend on cheerleader trainings. 
                  I smiled a bit, but he's my friend so it's okay for me. Then he told me the trainer's name and I was surprised. 
                  She was my pop-dance teacher during high-school.
                  My friend invited me to visit a traning and after it I can discuss with my ex-teacher as well. 
                  I akreed with it, let's see the girls and after it talk with my ex-teacher. <br />
                  My ex-teacher recognized me, she was happy to see me again. She wanted me to join to the cheerleader team. 
                  Previously I thought it is only for gays (except my friend !important), but my friend also was in this team, 
                  there are some nice girls, and at least I can spend more time with my friend, and with these girls it would be fun. 
                  Now the team had 2 boys. They could do more spectacular attraction like lift a girl to the air and hold his foot at boy's neckheight. </p>
              <p>But this is not american football, so about what do I speak? You are right, but this cheerleader team had sometimes training together
                   with the University's american football team (streching etc.). I thought these guys are really strong, but when I saw the collisions 
                   I thought something is not okay in their mind. To see the passes, to see how fast they can run it was awesome, what a nice play, and 
                   there were even less collide. I thought I can give it a try to see what I can do in a receiver position. The football team gave me a 
                   chance and they had no problem with me. I was fit in the team. So I started as a "Cheerboy" (some of my ex-teammate still use this 
                   name for me) and after it I became a wide-receiver in an american football team.</p>
