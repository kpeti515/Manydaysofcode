        <h3>Pluralsight</h3>
        <article>
            <p>My personal favorit.<br />It contain a lot of courses, from beginner to advanced.<br />
            I started with begginner courses, like HTML, HTML5.<br />With pathes you can learn specific topics deeper and everything is categorised<br />
            Unfortunately it is not free, but worth the price if you really want to learn.</p>

        One and a half hour is not so much for coding, from next day I will re-use what I can, to improve my coding speed - don't have to code every little tag itself - i think so. <br />
