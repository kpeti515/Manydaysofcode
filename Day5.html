            <p>To ensure good product quality companies started employing quality enginners.They are responsible to avoid that wrong parts could reach the customers.
            <br /> They don't check every features on a single part (but there are some features what have to check in 100% for sure).
            <br /> Their methods make the production able to use statistics and controls where you do not have to measure all parts but you can be sure that all part is good.
            <br /> A problem in the field can lead to customer claim and an <abbr title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr> can loss a lot of money on it. 
            <br /> Ensuring same quality cost money, but it is more less than some claim costs.
            <br /> Nowadays everythinh is around safety and money. To ensure a new development is enough safety <abbr title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr>s and suppliers make a lot of test. No one want to see a death caused by a vehicle.
