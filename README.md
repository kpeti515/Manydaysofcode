# Manydaysofcode
Jumped into programming

I always liked computer science. In elementary school I wanted to be programmer, 
but my actual informatics teacher told my parent that market will be full in few years later, so they told me to chosse another path.

Now I am 30 years old, and I see that market is always open if you have a strong willingness to be in and you are able to do for it...

Purpose of this session: learn coding skills, improve from day to day, after a year try to find work in IT sector as programmer/developer.

Original challange is 100days of code, but I do not have so much time to code every day. What I can do is learn and code, but not all days.

So I decided I will list my daily progress here, to see what I can reach during a year.

Check out my daily process below: (YYYY.MM.DD format)

2019.09.01 (Day15) - Blackjack in Javascript Part1, so much bug.... card request from dealer still missing.
Source for Day15: Pluralsight - https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=javascript-getting-started&author=mark-zamoyta&name=9e8bca7b-a402-4a88-b542-034e80c099e9&clip=5&mode=live

2019.09.02: My ordered RX 580 graphics card arrived :)  Day15 Blackjack minor bugfixes, still have to do the hit and stay functions

2019.09.03: Had some problem after RX 580 install- fixed, Programming: only W3schools were read

2019.09.04: Day 15 finished - hit, stay, exit buttons programmed, can handle TIE situation too.

2019.09.05: Watched about 1 hour of https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=javascript-practical-design-patterns&author=jonathan-mills&name=javascript-practical-design-patterns-m3&clip=9&mode=live

2019.09.06: Finished with https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=javascript-practical-design-patterns&author=jonathan-mills&name=javascript-practical-design-patterns-m3&clip=9&mode=live
Offtopic: Ordered i5 9400F + CPU cooler + 8 GB RAM + B360M Pro 4 - next week my computer will be fully upgraded.

2019.09.07: Day off - Traveled to my parents.

2019.09.08: Day 16 : FIZBUZZ
Made the Pluralsight SkillIQ test - I'm happy with the result, but I have to practice more. 
Completed Navbar dropdown days block, scrolling work only with inline style actually.... Main page navbar added.
Started to watch https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=javascript-best-practices&author=jonathan-mills&name=javascript-best-practices-m1&clip=0&mode=live

2019.09.09 FIZZBUZZ revamp. What happen if you try to use setTimeout in a for cycle? Awww maaan... Meh'... it was a hard lesson to know how the engine and the closures work, but solved the issue. 8 GB ram + a cpu cooler arrived, waiting only for motherboard + cpu.

2019.09.10. Still FIZZBUZZ... Made a more cleaner code, and implemented my expected behavior to the calculating (it looks like that the computer processing the datas as slow as a human would). Continued to watch best practicies for javascript at pluralsight.
