# Manydaysofcode
Jumped into programming

I always liked computer science. In elementary school I wanted to be programmer, 
but my actual informatics teacher told my parent that market will be full in few years later, so they told me to chosse another path.

Now I am 30 years old, and I see that market is always open if you have a strong willingness to be in and you are able to do for it...

Purpose of this session: learn coding skills, improve from day to day, after a year try to find work in IT sector as programmer/developer.

Original challange is 100days of code, but I do not have so much time to code every day. What I can do is learn and code, but not all days.

So I decided I will list my daily progress here, to see what I can reach during a year.

Check out my daily process below: (YYYY.MM.DD format)

2019.09.01 (Day15) - Blackjack in Javascript Part1, so much bug.... card request from dealer still missing.
