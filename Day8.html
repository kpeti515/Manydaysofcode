            <p>
                Did you imagine how many parts are in a car?
                Do you know how many problems can occour with a single part?
                How can an <abbr title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr> ensure that the car owners don't get a piece of shit for their money?
            </p>

                To ensure good product quality, companies started employing quality enginners.They are responsible to avoid that wrong parts could reach the customers.
                <br /> They don't check every features on a single part (but there are some features what have to check in 100% for sure).
                <br /> Their methods make the production able to use statistics and controls where you do not have to measure all parts but you can be sure that all part is good.
            <p>
                A problem in the field can lead to customer claim and an <abbr title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr> can loss a lot of money on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ensuring same quality cost money, but it is more less than some claim costs.
                <br /> Nowadays everythinh is around safety and money. To ensure a new development is enough safety <abbr title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr>s and suppliers make a lot of test. No one want to see a death caused by a vehicle.
